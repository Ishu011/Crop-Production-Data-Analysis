# Crop-Production-Data-Analysis



## Project Overview

The **Crop Production Data Analysis** project focuses on analyzing and visualizing crop production data to gain insights into agricultural trends and predict future crop yields. The dataset used in this project includes information about different crops, their production volumes, and the areas they cover in various regions. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning models to evaluate and predict crop production.


## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Create detailed plots to visualize crop production, area of cultivation, and the relationships between them.
- 
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement and compare different regression models including Random Forest and Linear Regression.
- 
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine the effectiveness of predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- `numpy` - For numerical operations
- 
- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
- 
- `matplotlib` - For plotting graphs
- 
- `seaborn` - For advanced data visualization
- 
- `scikit-learn` - For machine learning algorithms and evaluation

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/Ishu011/crop-production-data-analysis.git
    
    cd crop-production-data-analysis
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. **Prepare the Data**: Ensure that your dataset (`crop_production_data.csv`) is placed in the `data` directory.

2. **Run Data Analysis**: Execute the main script to perform data analysis and model training.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

   This script performs the following:
   
   - Loads and preprocesses the data
   - 
   - Generates visualizations for exploratory analysis
   - 
   - Trains Random Forest and Linear Regression models
   - 
   - Evaluates model performance and generates plots for comparison

### Results

- **Data Visualizations**: Includes bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms to visualize crop production and area data.
- 
- **Model Performance**: Compares the RMSE of Random Forest and Linear Regression models to assess their predictive accuracy.
